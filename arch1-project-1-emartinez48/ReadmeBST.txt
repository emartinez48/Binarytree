# Arch1-BST-Demo

This Directory contains:
*Code that Implements a Binary search tree
*Withing that code a demo of the program.

The code provided uses the following header files
<stdlib.h> This File allows us to use Malloc to free space for our nodes.  We are also using sizeof to get the size of the string.
<stdio.h>  This library allows us to take input and output from a file.  The functions included are Printf ScanF fprintf
<string.h>  We use String to compare the compare strings and determine which one is bigger.  Two funcitons used are strcmp and strcpy.  Strcpy is used to copy a string into our structure.

To compile:
----------
make

To Test and try
--------
make run

To delete binaries
----------------
make clean

Functions and limitations
The following code is to fulfills the follow requirements
*Stores first names of employees into a Binary search tree while maintaing the structure.
*Provides an Interface which allows the user to pick a function
*Print names in Alphabetical order
*Add a name
*Delete a name with no Children
*Import a file
*Export a File

Credit and Collaberations
With the help of classmate Cesar Garcia and TA David Pruitt I was able to compete my insert function which I used as a basis to complete the rest of the project.  After, ideas were shared to complete the project and recieved help in debugging and working on the file.
